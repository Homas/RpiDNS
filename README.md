## Overview

RpiDNS on the [ioc2rpz community](https://ioc2rpz.net) web-site provides simplified configuration interface and an installation script to provision DNS security at your home, office or home office.  

The RpiDNS project on github is a web-interface for RpiDNS. It can be used with a standalone ISC Bind instance. In that case some configuration changes may be required on ISC Bind side and/or RpiDNS.

## User interface

### Reporting periods
Reporting period is defined by a selector located in top right corner.
You can select:
- 30m - 30 minutes;
- 1h - 1 hour;
- 1d - 1 day;
- 1w - 1 week;
- 30d - 30 days;
- custom (not implemented).
Depending on the period different tables will be used. 30m and 1d based on raw log messages, other reports on a mix of raw data and aggregated data (per 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day). 
### Tools
Widgets on the dashboard and reports offers various tools depending on the context. From the dashboard you can drill-down to the reports by using "show queries" or "show hits" tools. A relevant report will be opened with a defined filter based on data type in a widget.  
For threat hunting, investigation of false positives RpiDNS offers multiple research tools. When you click on a tool a new browser window is opened and an indicator is passed to a 3rd party web-site.  
The research tools include:
- DuckDuckGo - search engine concerned about privacy;
- Google - generic search engine;
- VirusTotal - service which allows to validate if a domain, IP, URL, file, file hash is malicious or not.
- RiskIQ Community - service which provides access to passive DNS data and other digital footprint (PassiveTotal and Digital Footprint community editions).
- DomainTools Whois - domain and IP registration information.
- Robtex - provides public information about IP numbers, domain names, host names, Autonomous systems, routes etc. 
- Apility.io - threat intelligence SaaS for developers and product companies that want to know in realtime if their existing or potential users have been classified as 'abusers'â€‹ by one or more of these lists.
- ThreatMiner - ThreatMiner is a threat intelligence portal that provides information on indicators of compromise (IOC) such as domains, IP address, malware samples etc.

### Dashboard

The widget shows topX DNS requests which were not blocked.
#### TopX Allowed Clients
The widget shows topX clients which requests were not blocked.
#### TopX Allowed Request Types
The widget shows topX request types (e.g. A, AAAA, MX).
#### RpiDNS
The widget shows information about RpiDNS: CPU utilization, Memory utilization, Disk utilization, Uptime, GPU temperature
#### TopX Blocked Requests
The widget shows topX DNS requests which were blocked.
#### TopX Blocked Clients
The widget shows topX clients which requests were blocked.
#### TopX Feeds

- Server - server IP;
- Request - requested fqdn;
- Type - request type;
- Class - request class;

## Scripts
### rpidns_install.sh
It is an installation script. It pulls required libraries, tools, packages (except a web-server), copy files to directories, init the database and setup crontab tasks.
It was written for Raspbian, other Linux distribution currently are not supported but you can easily update it.

### init_db.php
The DB initialization script.

### clean_db.php
The script is executed by crontab and removes old log messages from the DB. The DB is cleaned up by native sqlite3 "VACUUM" command.

### parce_bind_logs.php
The script parces bind's query and rpz log files, saved logs in the DB and performs data aggregation. The script is executed by cron every minute.

## ISC Bind configuration
To work with RpiDNS ISC Bind should:
- export DNS queries and RPZ hits into a log-file
- local RPZs: wl.ioc2rpz.local, wl-ip.ioc2rpz.local, bl.ioc2rpz.local, bl-ip.ioc2rpz.local

## Database

## Built with
- [VUE.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [bootstrap-vue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
